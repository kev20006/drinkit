    "description": "The Dark and Stormy cocktail was not born from the windy blackness of London, nor was it created in a barroom catering to the alcoholic needs of woebegone writers. In fact, it has nothing to do with bad literary tropes and gothic language. The Dark and Stormy is a drink that came to be in the Caribbean waters, where rum is plentiful and so are sailors. It’s a drink that was spit out by the sea, more or less. It’s a drink with a really cool name.",
